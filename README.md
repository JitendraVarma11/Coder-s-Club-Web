# CodersClub-Web
I developed this website for the Coder's Club at LDCE to showcase my web development skills. The project involves creating a fully responsive and visually appealing website using HTML, CSS and Js. The site features various sections such as an events page, an home page, our team, and etc. The goal of this project is to provide a professional-looking platform for a fictional club, demonstrating my ability to build and style web pages effectively.
